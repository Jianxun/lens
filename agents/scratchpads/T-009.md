# T-009 — Frontend MVP
## Context
- ChatGPT-like UI: left sessions list, main chat thread, markdown assistant bubbles.
- Streaming `/chat`; send full history by default.
- Show retrieval histogram in collapsible panel; keep cited turn_ids available.

## Scope / Allowed files
- `frontend/` (new; e.g., Vite/React)
- Minimal config; no heavy theming.

## Requirements
- Sessions list (title, updated_at, pinned/archived hidden) via `/sessions`.
- Load history via `/sessions/{id}`; render bubbles (user right, assistant left, markdown).
- Composer with send + Shift+Enter for newline.
- Streaming consumption of `/chat`; append tokens live.
- Display collapsible histogram (from `/chat` response metadata) and optionally cited turn_ids.
- Full history sent by default; no client truncation.

## DoD
- UI shows sessions, loads history, streams replies; histogram panel renders when provided.
