# Handoff

## Current state
- Context scaffolding is in place: contract, tasks, handoff, tasks_archived, and codebase_map now exist alongside lessons.
- Project scope and deliverables are not yet defined; repo contains only agent role/context documents.

## Last verified
- 2025-12-24: `ls agents/context` shows all context files present.

## Next steps (1–3)
- Clarify project objectives with the user and expand the contract overview accordingly.
- Define first implementation tasks (T-003+) and update the tasks board.
- Extend the codebase_map when new modules or directories are added.

## Risks / unknowns
- Project scope and success criteria are not yet specified.  
- No application code exists, so future integration points are unknown.
